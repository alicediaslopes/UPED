# Packages ----------------------------------------------------------------
# install.packages("tidyverse") 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Data --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Download the Round 6 of the European Social Survey dataset
# Link: https://www.europeansociasurvey.org/data/download.html?r=6
# Because the isn't a CSV version of the ESS6, we will need to use the package foreig an to open it in R.
# install.packages("foreign") 
library(foreign)
help(package = "foreign") # documentation for the package foreign
ESS6 <- read.spss("Week 4/Data/ESS6/ESS6e02_4.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE, use.missings = FALSE) # there are a lot of warning when you open the dataset. 
warnings() # the warning are for variables that contain date and factor variables with several levels.

# Weights --------------------------------------------------------------------
# For more on weights in R: https://www.r-bloggers.com/social-science-goes-r-weighted-survey-data/
#install.packages("survey")
library(survey) # we will use the package survey to deal with weights, but there are more options available in R.

# Weights available in the ESS:
# pweight: different probabilities of selection by country population sizes.
# dweight: different probabilities of selection of different kind of respondent within each country.
# pspwght: uses census or other information to match the achieved sample to known information about the target population.

# For this exercise, we will use mainly the pweight.
ESS6_w <- svydesign(ids = ~1, data = ESS6, weights = ESS6$pweight)

# Recoding Variables  --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's explore respondent attitudes towards homosexuality: 
# The variable freehms describes respondents' attitudes towards homosexuality by asking how far they (dis) 
# agree with the statement 'Gays and lesbians should be free to live life as they wish.'

# Let's run a frequency table for freehms.
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~freehms, design = ESS6_w)),2)

# What other variables you think might affect individuals' attitudes towards homosexuality?
# Let explore ...

# Relationship between freehms and categorical variables.
# gndr: gender
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~freehms + gndr, design = ESS6_w),2),2)
# rlgblg: belonging to particular religion or denomination
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~freehms + rlgblg, design = ESS6_w),2),2)
# rlgdnm: religion or denomination belonging to at present
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~freehms + rlgdnm, design = ESS6_w),2),2)
# lrscale: placement on left right scale
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~freehms + lrscale, design = ESS6_w),2),2)

# Relationship between interval variables.


# We can reduce the freehms variable into two categories: all those who strongly agree and agree, and all those who strongly disagree and disagree. We would treat those 
# who neither agree or disagree as missing. 

ESS6$freehms2[ESS6$freehms =='Agree strongly' | ESS6$freehms == 'Agree'] <- 1 
ESS6$freehms2[ESS6$freehms =='Disagree strongly' | ESS6$freehms == "Disagree"] <- 2
ESS6$freehms2[ESS6$freehms =='Neither agree nor disagree' | ESS6$freehms == "Refusal" |
                ESS6$freehms == "Don't know" | ESS6$freehms == " No answer"] <- 3

# It is always good to check if everything has gone correctly. You can do a crosstab between the old and new variable.
table(ESS6$freehms, ESS6$freehms2)

# Subsetting and selecting cases  --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's explore gender differences in home activities and labour market outcomes.
# It makes sense to compare men and women in a similar stage in life: completed education and working. Let's look at men and women aged 25-49.

# First you need to create a variable selecting the individuals we are interested in.
class(ESS6$agea)
ESS6$agea<- as.numeric(as.character(ESS6$agea))

ESS6_filter<- ESS6[ which(ESS6$agea >= 25 & ESS6$agea <= 49), ]

# Adding the weight to the new dataset.
ESS6_w2 <- svydesign(ids = ~1, data = ESS6_filter, weights = ESS6_filter$pweight)

# The mnactic variable records what the main activity of respondents was in the week before their interview. 
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~mnactic, design = ESS6_w2)),2)

# Our focus is in whether women are active in the labour market. We will recode the variable:
# Paid work (1) + Unemployed, looking for job (3): 1
# Education (2) + Unemployed, not looking for job (4) + Permanently sick or disabled (5) + Retired (6) + Community or military service (7) + Other (9): 2
# Housework, looking after children, others (8): 3

ESS6_filter$mbw[ESS6_filter$mnactic =='Paid work' | ESS6_filter$mnactic == "Unemployed, looking for job"] <- 1 
ESS6_filter$mbw[ESS6_filter$mnactic =='Education' | ESS6_filter$mnactic == "Unemployed, not looking for job" |
           ESS6_filter$mnactic == "Permanently sick or disabled" | ESS6_filter$mnactic == "Retired" |
           ESS6_filter$mnactic == "Community or military service" | ESS6_filter$mnactic == "Other" ] <- 2 
ESS6_filter$mbw[ESS6_filter$mnactic =='Housework, looking after children, others'] <- 3

# checking recoding
table(ESS6_filter$mbw, ESS6_filter$mnactic)

# Because we are going to compare individuals countries, rather than all countries together, we will change our weight to pspwght.
ESS6_w3 <- svydesign(ids = ~1, data = ESS6_filter, weights = ESS6_filter$pspwght)

# three-way contingency table
economic_activity <- round(100*prop.table(svytable(~mbw + gndr + cntry, design = ESS6_w3),c(2,3)),2)
# save the table as a csv file (you will need to edit the table using pivot tables or you can try to use tidyr and dplyr package to create this table)
write.csv(economic_activity, "Week 4/Data/economic_activity_table.csv")
